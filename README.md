**Audit-driven protocol risk & coverage logic**

protocolcover documents how blockchain protocol risks can be classified,
audited, and translated into enforceable coverage triggers.

**This repository hosts the public, non-commercial specification layer
backing https://protocolcover.com (canonical).**

---

## Purpose

Many protocol-level coverage failures originate from structural ambiguity:
- risk categories are vague
- audits are not mapped to coverage logic
- failure modes are undefined

protocolcover treats protocol risk as **infrastructure risk** —
auditable, classifiable, and referenceable.

---

## Scope

- Smart-contract risk taxonomy
- Audit evidence requirements
- Coverage trigger & exclusion logic
- On-chain vs. off-chain accountability

---
