# protocolcover

**Audit-driven protocol risk & coverage logic**

protocolcover documents how blockchain protocol risks can be classified,
audited, and translated into enforceable coverage triggers.

This repository hosts the public specification layer.

---

## Purpose

Most protocol insurance fails because:
- risk categories are vague
- audits are not mapped to coverage logic
- failure modes are undefined

protocolcover treats protocol risk as **infrastructure risk**.

---

## Scope

- Smart-contract risk taxonomy
- Audit evidence requirements
- Coverage triggers & exclusions
- On-chain vs. off-chain accountability

---

## What this is not

- Not an insurance product
- Not a protocol endorsement
- Not financial advice

---

## Architecture

- Static reference
- GitHub Pages
- No backend
- No data collection

---

## Status
